NAME

    sabx_map_staging - make a simplified staging map

SYNOPSIS

    sabx_map_staging [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION

    Take an SABX 1.0 file and use it to generate a simplified HTML map.  This
    map will use Google Maps to display the map.  It's different from the
    full-featured HTML maps in that it doesn't display instructions, parking,
    stops, pois, pictures, etc... This is designed to help visualize an SABX
    file that's been generated from a GPX or TCX file and hasn't yet had all
    the segments, stops, pois, parking, etc... defined yet.

    -i INFILE, --infile=INFILE
        SABX 1.0 file to read from

    -o OUTFILE, --outfile=OUTFILE
        HTML file to write to

    -r MARKERDIR, --marker-dir=MARKERDIR
        relative web directory for marker files

    -g IMAGEDIR, --image-dir=IMAGEDIR
        relative web directory for image files

    -c CSSDIR, --css-dir=CSSDIR
        relative web directory for css files

    -j JSDIR, --js-dir=JSDIR
        relative web directory for javascript files

    -b BASEDIR, --base-dir=BASEDIR
        relative base web directory

    -m, --man
        print this extended help and exit

    -h, --help
        print basic help and exit
