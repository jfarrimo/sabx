      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
	This tutorial expects you to have a firm grasp of the layout of an SABX
	file and the intricacies of how its data elements interact.  Please
	first read the SABX file format specification 
	<a href="http://www.sabikerides.com/sabx/1/0/index.html">here</a> if
	you don't already know this.  Since there is quite a bit of
	hand-editing of SABX files necessary for these tutorials, understanding
	their layout is essential.  You'll also need to have the
	<a href="http://www.sabikerides.com/sabx/1/0/sabx10.html">sabx10</a>
	package installed so that the utilities mentioned in this tutorial will
	be available.
      </p>
      <h2 id="two">Create An SABX File</h2>
      <p>
	The main thing you're going to want to do with SABX files is create
	them.
      </p>
      <h3 id="two1">1 get a GPX or TCX file</h3>
      <p>
	I create these by downloading data from my GPS to the computer.
      </p>
      <h3 id="two2">2 convert it into an SABX file</h3>
      <p>
	The utilities gpx2sabx and tcx2sabx are used for this.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <p>
	For the example I'll assume we're starting with a GPX file named
	sample.gpx.  I'll convert it into a file named sample_raw.sabx to
	denote that it's the raw, unprocessed SABX information.
      </p>
      <pre>$ gpx2sabx -i sample.gpx -o sample_raw.sabx</pre>
      <h3 id="two3">3 convert that into an HTML file</h3>
      <p>
	Use sabx2html for this.  It creates an HTML file that contains a Google
	Map of the ride with the waypoints as pushpins for easy identification.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>$ sabx2html -i sample_raw.sabx -o sample.html</pre>
      <h3 id="two4">4 create a blank CSV file</h3>
      <p>
	sabx_csv does this with the "-b" option.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>$ sabx_csv -b sample.csv</pre>
      <h3 id="two5">5 fill-in the ride description, parking, stops, pois, and
      roads in the CSV</h3>
      <p>
	Open the blank CSV file and fill it in.  I usually use the OpenOffice
	spreadsheet program for this.  The help for sabx_csv explains what all
	the fields are and how to use them.
      </p>
      <h3 id="two6">6 use the HTML map to fill-in the starting and ending
      points for roads</h3>
      <p>
	Look at the waypoints on the HTML map and decide which ones are the
	start and end points for each segment.  Remember that adjoining
	segments will end on one point and then start on the next one (no
	overlap).  This is because the SABX format assumes that the end point
	for a segment is really the starting point of the next segment and
	adjusts things accordingly.
      </p>
      <h3 id="two7">7 fill-in the parking, stop, and poi (lat,lon) with
      points or real (lat,lon) data</h3>
      <p>
	Again, use the HTML map to choose points for parking, stops, and pois.
	If you have actual (lat,lon) values for any of those, use them instead.
	When merging with the SABX file, any (lat,lon) values for the stops and
	pois will be matched to the closest waypoints.
      </p>
      <h3 id="two8">8 merge the CSV file and the SABX file</h3>
      <p>
	Use sabx_csv for this.  It will merge the data from the two files
	together and form an SABX file from it all.  Look over the new SABX
	file to make sure everything looks right.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <p>
	Notice that we put the merged data into sample.sabx, preserving the
	sample_raw.sabx file.  This way we can re-run the merge if we find any
	major problems when inspecting the new file.
      </p>
      <pre>$ sabx_csv -i sample_raw.sabx -o sample.sabx sample.csv</pre>
      <h3 id="two9">9 add the USGS elevation data to the SABX file</h3>
      <p>
	Use sabx_usgs for this.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <p>
	Notice that I am specifying the same file name for both input and
	output files.  This effectively updates sample.sabx by over-writing the
	original copy with the updated copy.
      </p>
      <pre>$ sabx_usgs -i sample.sabx -o sample.sabx</pre>
      <h3 id="two10">10 remove any stray points from the SABX file</h3>
      <p>
	While mapping the ride, I sometimes will make stops, stray from the
	course, turn around to get people, etc... This can create extra
	waypoints in the ride that look funny and give bad distances when
	processed.  Use the HTML map to identify any of these and remove them
	from the SABX file by hand using a text editor.
      </p>
      <h3 id="two11">11 renumber the updated SABX file</h3>
      <p>
	Renumber the updated SABX file so that its ids are consistent.  You
	don't have to do this to make things function, but it's nice for anyone
	who has to later read the file.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>$ sabx_number -i old.sabx -o old.sabx</pre>
      <h3 id="two12">12 fill-in the rest of the data for the SABX file</h3>
      <p>
	Mostly this is just things like overall description, zip prefix,
	photos, and history.  I use a text editor for this.
      </p>
      <h3 id="two13">13 proof your work</h3>
      <p>
	Come on, you know you should!
      </p>
      <h2 id="three">Add A Ride To An SABX File</h2>
      <p>
	In addition to creating new SABX files, you're also going to want to
	add new rides to existing files.
      </p>
      <h3 id="three1">1 create an SABX file containing the new ride</h3>
      <p>
	Start off by following the instructions of section 2 to create a new
	SABX file with the new ride.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <p>
	For this example, we'll call the new file new.sabx and the existing
	file old.sabx.
      </p>
      <h3 id="three2">2 re-number the new SABX file so it doesn't conflict
      with the old one</h3>
      <p>
	Next, renumber the new SABX file so that its ids don't clash with those
	of the SABX file you're adding to.  Open the old file in a text editor
	and look through it to see what its highest id is.  I usually then
	renumber the new file to a much higher starting value just to be sure
	nothing overlaps.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>$ sabx_number -i new.sabx -o new.sabx -s 10000</pre>
      <h3 id="three3">3 copy the parking, turns, segments, stops, and pois
      over to the old one</h3>
      <p>
	Open the old and new SABX files in a text editor.  Copy the parking,
	turns, segments, stops, and pois from the new file to the old file.
      </p>
      <h3 id="three4">4 re-point your duplicate segment stops and pois to
      ones already in file</h3>
      <p>
	It's common for new rides to share stops and pois with the rides in the
	old SABX file.  Change the references in the new segment waypoints to
	point to the old stops and pois that they share.
      </p>
      <h3 id="three5">5 copy the ride over</h3>
      <p>
	Copy the ride itself from the new file into the old one.
      </p>
      <h3 id="three6">6 if using existing parking, point ride parking to
      existing one</h3>
      <p>
	If you're using an existing parking place in the new ride, change its
	reference in the ride.
      </p>
      <h3 id="three7">7 if some new and old turns and/or segments are
      duplicates, point ride at originals</h3>
      <p>
	It's common for new rides to have some overlap with the rides in the
	old SABX file.  Point the new ride to the old segments and turns so
	that new and old rides share them.  Do this by changing the references
	in the new ride to have the ids from the old turns and/or segments.
      </p>
      <h3 id="three8">8 get rid of any now-unused items</h3>
      <p>
	Now that you have copied all the information for the new ride into the
	old file, and pointed the new ride to use existing parking, turns,
	segments, stops, and pois, there is probably some unused data items
	left over from the new file.  Use the sabx_cleanup utility to remove
	these from the updated SABX file.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>$ sabx_cleanup -i old.sabx -o old.sabx</pre>
      <h3 id="three9">9 renumber the updated SABX file</h3>
      <p>
	Renumber the updated SABX file so that its ids are consistent.  You
	don't have to do this to make things function, but it's nice for anyone
	who has to later read the file.
      </p>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
      <pre>$ sabx_number -i old.sabx -o old.sabx</pre>
      <h3 id="three10">10 add a change to the history reflecting new
      ride</h3>
      <p>
	Add a change to the history section of the SABX file with the current
	date and a description of what was added.
      </p>
      <h3 id="three11">11 proof your work</h3>
      <p>
	Just go ahead and do it.  You won't regret it.
