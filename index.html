      <p>
	I've been an avid bicyclist for many years.  I will quite often travel
	to ride, or try to ride while I'm traveling.  I always run into the
	problem of figuring out where to ride when I travel.  Sometimes I'll
	find good maps, but most often they are either poor or non-existent.
      </p>
      <p>
	This started me thinking that someone traveling to my city might have
	the same problems I have.  Since I've ridden so much around my town, I
	decided it might be nice for me to make and share maps of the good
	local rides.
      </p>
      <p>
	In the course of building the maps, I generated a lot of software to
	help in the process.  I'm now open sourcing it so that anyone else can
	use it.
      </p>
      <p>
	The site itself is 
	<a href="http://www.sabikerides.com/">SABikeRides.com</a>.  I'm not
	open-sourcing the actual ride data I've developed, just the software I
	use to maintain the data and turn it into maps.
      </p>
      <p>
	By the way, I like programming in Python, so most of the software to
	support the sited was written in Python.  The exceptions are (of
	course) the parts needed for the HTML versions of the maps.  Otherwise,
	it's Python, all the way down.
      </p>
      <h2 id="format">SABX File Format</h2>
      <p>
	The first thing I realized was that I needed some way to store the ride
	data.  I didn't want to just make web pages out of it, I wanted to have
	a presentation-neutral format that I could turn into whatever kinds of
	maps I wanted.  I didn't put it in a database, because I wanted the
	data for each ride to stand on its own.  Insteady, I decided to make a
	file format for this.  I based it on XML since XML is pretty popular,
	is human-readable, and has tons of tools to support it. What I came up
	with is a format I've named SABX (short for SABikerides XML format).
      </p>
      <p>
	The format is specified here: 
	<a href="1/0/index.html">SABX 1.0 File Format</a>
      </p>
      <h2 id="foundation">Foundation Code</h2>
      <p>
	After creating the file format, the next thing I noticed was that the
	libraries available for dealing with XML were pretty generic.  I mean,
	they do a good job of handling the XML, but they present the data in a
	very generic format that doesn't relate closely to the SABX file format
	schema.  Therefore, I generated a library that takes the XML SABX files
	and transforms them into Python objects that have a much closer
	correspondence with the SABX data. I also noticed that for just about
	anything I was going to do with the data, I needed to do some basic
	calculations on it, so I added that to the library as well.  The
	library that handles all of this is called <em>oxm</em> (short for
	object-XML mapper).
      </p>
      <p>
	I also decided somewhat early on in the project that I would need a way
	to turn the XML files into other types of files, such as HTML and PDF
	maps.  I briefly thought about using XSLT to do this, but I never could
	get a good comfort level with that language.  It just felt like a weird
	kludge.  So, I decided to use Python and a templating engine instead.
	After much research...  Well, not really.  I just asked my friend
	Chuck, who's really knowledgable about these sorts of things, and he
	suggested I try Jinja.  It's close to Django's templating language, and
	I wanted whatever I did to be easily portable to Django in the future,
	so that's the one I chose.
      </p>
      <p>
	After playing with Jinja for a while, I noticed a lot of code patterns
	I kept running into to use it, so I extracted those out into another
	library, called <em>templating</em>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
      <p>
	Well, obviously, foundation code doesn't do you much good unless you
	have other code that calls it.  Also, building SABX files by hand
	rapidly became tiresome.  So rapidly, in fact, that I never actually
	built a whole one by hand.  I immediately went to work creating some
	utilities that could manipulate them.  The utilities let you do all
	kinds of things to existing SABX files, and also give you the ability
	to create new SABX files from existing GPX and TCX files.  This is a
	good thing since the data for the rides comes from GPS units.  Many
	such units can be coaxed into producing GPX files from the rides they
	record, hence my support for that format.  I use the bicycle-specific
	Garmin units, therefore the somewhat Garmin-specific TCX format is
	supported as well. It's interesting to note that both the GPX and TCX
	formats are XML formats, just like my SABX format.  I guess great minds
	think alike. And name formats (kind of) alike.  Anyway, I stuck this
	code into a package named, appropriately, <em>utils</em>. I also wrote
	some scripts to call into <em>utils</em>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="maps">Map Generation</h2>
      <p>
	So, now that I've generated my lovely SABX files, I still haven't made
	any maps.  And maps are the real goal of this whole project.  So, I
	made some software to take the SABX files and generate maps from them.
      </p>
      <p>
	The first kind of maps I made were HTML based, since I wanted to be
	able to share them on the web.  I'm a computer geek kind of person, so
	this was a natural thing for me.  Although, I'm probably the only
	computer geek I know of who's in imminent danger of getting skin cancer
	from being outside riding my bike so much.  The other computer geeks I
	know can barely walk a straight line, much less ride a bike. They
	certainly couldn't manage to physically exert themselves for several
	hours in a row. I could name names, but that's not relevant here.
      </p>
      <p>
	I ended up using Google Maps for displaying the maps, and a bunch of
	Jquery stuff to make them do fancy things.  Google Maps is really cool,
	but if I were starting from scratch now, I'd probably use Open Street
	Map and its related software ecosystem.  It's not any better than
	Google Maps, but it is open source and it has a great, very accesible
	community.
      </p>
      <p>
	The HTML maps looked really cool on the computer screen, but they
	sucked if you wanted to print them out and take them with you on an
	actual bike ride.  So, I spent a bunch of time figuring out how to make
	maps that looked good when you printed them and could actually help you
	navigate your bicycle on roads.  I ended-up discovering the Mapnik
	project, which is what Open Street Maps uses to render their maps.  It
	does a super job making maps, really as good as any commercial maps
	I've seen on the web.  In fact, it's so good that I can't make it do
	nearly as good things as I know it's capable of.  That's because I'm
	artistically stunted, not because the software has any problems.  In
	the end, I was able to generate high-resolution maps and turn
	instructions in a handy PDF format that's easily used by cyclists.
      </p>
      <p>
	Of course, the obvious question is, "why would a self-respecting geek
	like yourself bother with paper maps when you have that nifty smart
	phone in your pocket that has a GPS built in and should be able to do
	awesome things with your maps?"  Well, that's a darn good question. The
	answer is that, phones or no phones, you have to have paper maps.  I've
	never had paper maps run out of batteries on a ride, and I've never met
	many cyclists who couldn't figure out how to make a paper map work.
	They may not be able to figure out how to fold the paper map back up
	when they're done, but they certainly know how to use them. Still, I'm
	hoping that someday I'll have the time to finally write that phone
	application, but until then, the paper maps will have to do.
      </p>
      <p>
	Anyway, by the time I stopped working on this software (I can't say
	<em>finished</em> because I'll never feel like it's done), I had made
	software that will create HTML and PDF versions of my maps.  It's all
	included in the <em>map</em>, <em>osm</em>, <em>pdf_gen</em>, and
	<em>profiles</em> packages.
      </p>
      <h2 id="sabx10">SABX10 Library</h2>
      <p>
	Once I'd created all this wonderful software, I decided to give it away
	as an open source project.  This was partly out of altruism since I'd
	created it using (mostly) open source software.  It was also partly
	because I couldn't see any ready commercial value for it, so there was
	no reason to be stingy with it.
      </p>
      <p>
	While getting it ready to give away, I decided that I needed to package
	it all up so people could easily use it.  I took all the Python
	packages I'd created so far and rolled them into one great-big package
	called <em>sabx10</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
	The <em>sabx10</em> name neads some explanation.  I named it that
	because it currently handles the SABX 1.0 file format.  I'll generate
	an <em>sabx11</em> version when I upgrade the format, and so on.  I've
	struggled a bit with handling different SABX file versions, but I
	finally decided to build specific library versions for each file
	version.  This is because I want for each file version to be able to
	live on, not forcing anyone using it to have to upgrade before they
	want to.  Therefore, I'll maintain the library version for each file
	version indefinitely.  This may turn out to be a bad idea in the long
	run, but for the time being I'm going with it.
      </p>
      <p>
	The sabx10 package is available here: 
	<a href="1/0/sabx10.html">sabx10</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	So, now you've heard the story and seen the software.  The rest is up
	to you.  Happy trails!
